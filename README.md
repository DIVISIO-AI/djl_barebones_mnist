# DJL barebones MNIST example
A DJL MNIST Classifier Trainer &amp; Runner. A bit more verbose than necessary to illustrate the API of DJL. Does not use the DJL-builtin MNIST Dataset but a custom one to illustrate how to create custom datasets.

Normally, you would use the pre-existing MLP class to implement a fully connected network, but this is also done manually on purpose for didactic purposes.
